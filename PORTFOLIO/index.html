    <p>I’m an aspiring developer passionate about building practical and impactful applications using modern technologies. I’ve been learning web development and deepening my skills in areas like React, Redux, and backend integration. I'm also exploring advanced AI concepts, including OCR and transformer-based models, to solve real-world problems. My projects reflect a hands-on approach, continuous learning, and a drive to create clean, user-focused solutions.

      <h3>Insta Clone</h3>
      <p>I built a full-stack Instagram clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). For image uploads, I integrated
Cloudinary, allowing users to securely store and manage media files in the cloud. The application uses a MongoDB Atlas cloud server for
scalable database management.
The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the backend is hosted on Render for reliable performance. To enhance user experience with realtime interactions, I implemented Socket.io, enabling instant messaging and real-time notifications.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Django Twitter</h3>
      <p>I developed a Twitter clone using Django as the backend framework along with Jinja templating for dynamic HTML
rendering. The project includes core features like posting tweets, user authentication, following/unfollowing users, and
real-time feed updates. The application emphasizes clean design, efficient server-side rendering, and secure user
management. It has been deployed on Render to ensure scalability and stable hosting</p>
